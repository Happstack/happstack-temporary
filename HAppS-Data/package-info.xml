  <synopsis>Transparent conversion to/from XML and form-data
  </synopsis>
<!--
	Automagically convert haskell types to/from XML and name-value
	pairs for use in AJAX, web forms, and state serialization.

-->
  <description>
	Supports url-encoded or mime/multipart, type-specific
	representations, type-safe migrations, and public/private
	differentiation.  Let haskell's compiler help you make sure that,
	as the shape of your application types changes, you don't lose
	consistency with persistent internal state or the web
	forms/cookies waiting to be posted.
