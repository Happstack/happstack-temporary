  <synopsis>	
	High performance dynamic web serving framework
  </synopsis>

  <description>
	Write web services really easy using an elegant monadic framework
	for managing control-flow within your server.  Use the built-in
	proxy functionality so your ajax apps can easily access the data
	they need anywhere on the internet.  Take advantage of long
	transactions and lightweight threads for comet apps that need to
	handle tens of thousands of concurrent users on a single box and
	it can be as simple as:[% 
    import HAppS.Server 
    main = simpleHTTP nullConf [ method GET $ ok "Hello World" ] 
%]
