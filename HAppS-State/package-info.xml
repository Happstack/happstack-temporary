  <synopsis>	
	Global in memory Haskell state with ACID guarantees
  </synopsis>

  <description>
	Unplug your machine and restart and have your app recover to
	exactly where it left off.  HAppS-State spares you the need to
	deal with all the marshalling, consistency, and configuration
	headache that you would have if you used an external DBMS for this
	purpose.  Its component model makes it easy to compose big
	applications from smaller reliable parts.  Use event subscription
	to trigger IO actions and support comet-style or irc-bot
	applications.
