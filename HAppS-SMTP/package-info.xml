	send/receive/relay SMTP mail envelopes
  </synopsis>

  <description>
	The (retrySend) function takes a "HELO" domain, a directory in
	which to store unsent messages, and a dsn handler function.  It
	returns a function that queues mail to be sent using the mx
	servers of the mail recipients.  It does exponential backoff on
	delivery attempts until it gives up or succeeds.  The
	(receiveAndRelay) function accepts envelopes on a particular port
	and forwards using retrySend.  The (receive) function takes a
	hostname, a port, and a handle-recieved-envelope function and
	operates as an smtp server until terminated.  The (sendEnvs)
	function takes a "HELO" domain and a list of envelopes and
	delivers them to the MX servers of the envelope recipients, but
	does not attempt re-delivery.  Recieve doesn't yet handle smtp-auth.
